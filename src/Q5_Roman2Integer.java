 * Question 5 (20 marks)
 *
 * Write a java program to convert Roman numbers to integer.
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:
 * I, V, X, L, C, D and M
 *
 * Symbol   Value
 *   I        1
 *   V        5
 *   X        10
 *   L        50
 *   C        100
 *   D        500
 *   M        1000
 *
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
 * 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II.
 * The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
 * However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written
 * as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
 * There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 *  I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 *  X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 *  C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 *
 * Input: Roman number (user input, string type)
 * Output: print out corresponding integer
 *
 * Example: if the user enters 'LVIII', the program should output 'LVIII -> 58'
